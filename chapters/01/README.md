# Redux: The Single Immutable State Tree

In Redux weather your app is simple or complex your state are going to represent the `whole state` of your application as a `single JavaScript object`. 

All `mutations`, and `changes` in the state in Redux are `explicit`. It is possible to keep `track` of all of them.
